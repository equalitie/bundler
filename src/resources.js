 * function handlerName(options, callback, originalDocument, response)
 *
 * Handlers for the latter, set on the `resourceRetrieved` event have
 * the following signature:
 * function handlerName(requestFn, body, response, callback)
 *
 * See the README for more information about these kinds of hooks.
