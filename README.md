# bundler

A utility for bundling resources in web pages into a single page by inlining them
using the [data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).

It is designed to be easy to use from any context so that one can simply:

* Put a server in front of bundler to bundle pages for proxied requests
* Bundle pages served by an application
* Build utilities to bundle pages

and so on.

    npm test
